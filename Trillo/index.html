        Flexbox is a new module in CSS3 that makes it easy to align elements to one another,
        in different directions and orders;

        The main idea behind flexbox is to give the container the ability to expand and to shrink
        elements to best use all the available space;

        Flexbox replaces float layouts, using less, and more readable and logical code;

        Flexbox completely changes the way that we build one-dimensional layouts;

        A true revolution in CSS!

        The element in which we use flexbox is called flex container and all we have to do in order to 
        create a flex container is to set display property to flex. We can also set it to flex-inline ,
        which will then create a flex container. Then all the direct children of flex-container is called 
        the flex-items.

        There are 2 axis : 1) MAIN AXIS: right(+), left(-)
                           2) CROSS AXIS: top(-), bottom(+)

        Properties we use in CONTAINER :
        
        1) flex-direction: row | row-reverse | column | column-reverse
        2) flex-wrap: which simply defines if the Flex items should wrap into a new line if, 
                      there is not enough space in a flex container or not.
           flex-wrap: nowrap | wrap | wrap-reverse
        3) justify-content: this one defines how the Flex items will be aligned along the main axis
           justify-content: flex-start | flex-end | center | space-between | space-around | space-evenly
        4) align-items: how the flex items will be aligned along the cross axis, not the main axis.
           align-items: stretch | flex-start | flex-end | center | baseline 
        5) align-content: only applies when there is more than one row of Flex items.
           align-content: stretch | flex-start | flex-end | center | space-between | space-around 

        Properties we use in ITEM :

        1) align-self: auto | stretch | flex-start | flex-end | center | baseline 
        2) order: 0 | <integer>
        3) flex-grow: 0 | <integer>
        4) flex-shrink: 1 | <integer>
        5) flex-basis: auto | <length>
