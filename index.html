            Two modern aspects of modern responsive design are, without a doubt, 
            deciding about doing mobile first or desktop-first for their website or app, 
            as well as selecting breakpoints for our project, when writing media queries.

            1) Desktop-first-approach
                In the desktop-first approach, we optimize our interfaces for the large screens;
                Now later, when we make the website responsive, we simply write media queries, in order 
                to shrink the design to fit the smaller screens.
                In this case the way we do this is by writing media-queries to test for max-width

            2) Mobile-first-approach 
                In mobile-first-approach, we start writing CSS code for smaller screens, in order to 
                optimize for mobile. And then, move up to larger screens from there using media queries.
                In this case we do this by writing media queries to test for min-width

            3) Let's discuss about the different types of media queries that we have to write for each 
               approach: max-width for desktop-first and min-width for mobile-first.
               breakpoints in px are 0 600px 900px 1200px
               For Desktop-First the code is on the right side of spectrum 1200+
               Now in order to adapt our design to smaller screens, we write max-width: 600px <=> (is width <= 600px)
               So what this media query does , is that it basically checks if the current viewport width is smaller
               or equal to 600 pixels. And if it is, then all the CSS Code that is in media query will apply and if not
               that specific code will just not apply.

            4) Think of media queries as tools, to overriding specific parts of our CSS for specific viewport width.
               this work for all breakpoints and media queries ... so for 900px, 1200px.

            5) What if a phone has a width of 500 pixels ? Which media query will apply now? 
               Both above mentioned queries will apply, because both conditions are true
               500 < 600 , but , also less than 900 pixels

            6) Media queries don't add any importance or specificity to selectors so code order matters
               - media queries at the end!

            7) min-width: 600px <=> (is width >= 600px ?), is the current viewport width larger or equal to 600pixels
               this media query will apply only for screens larger or equal to 600pixels.
               with min-width we want to stay away from smaller screen sizes.

            8) Pros and Cons of mobile-first-design :

                                                    pros:
                                                        - narrow down our interfaces
                                                        - results in smaller,faster and more efficient products
                                                        - completely optimized for mobile users.
                                                        - prioritizes content over aesthetic design, which may be desirable
                                                    
                                                    cons:
                                                        - the desktop version might feel overly empty and 
                                                          simplistic
                                                        - More difficult and counterintuitive to develop;
                                                        - Less creative freedom, making it more difficult 
                                                          to create distinctive products;
                                                        - Clients are used to see a desktop version of the 
                                                          site as a prototype;
                                                        - Do your users even use the mobile internet? What's the 
                                                          purpose of your website.

            9) Breakpoints, are the viewport width at which we want our design to change or 
               in other words , where we want to put our media quereis. One thing is for sure 
               we have to decide breakpoints for our design.

            10) There are 3 ways of choosing breakpoints : 

                a) The bad way : The most popular one , simply using the width of popular devices 
                                 as the breakpoints. Designers really like to use Apple products 
                                 ,like the iPhone and the ipad, to set breakpoints for their screen 
                                 width. First problem you optimizing for one very specific device ignoring 
                                 all the users of other devices. Second this strategy is not future proof
                                 at all. If tommorow apple decides to completely change resolutions
                                 on all their devices, do you want to go ahead and change all the mdeia queries
                                 on all your projects that you've ever built ? We talk a lot about reusable 
                                 and maintainable code and using specific devices as breakpoints, is completely
                                 against all that logic.

                b) The good way : We llok at all the most-used device width on the entire internet, try to 
                                  group them together in a logical way and then pick our brekpoints from that
                                  We don't put brakpoints at on point but among similar devices width

                c) The perfect way : The perfect way to implement is to ignore devices all together and only
                                     look at your content and your design. Only look where design breaks.
                                     You begin at one size either mobile or desktop and then start increasing 
                                     your screen width or decreasing for desktop first. Then as soon as the design 
                                     breaks, which means that the design no longer works, it no longer looks okay,
                                     then you insert a new breakpoint.
                                     So you start to put the breakpoints wherever your design starts to look weird
                                     and out of place and don't think about devices at all.
                                     without predifend breakpints.

                In this project we will use the second approach the good one 
                http://gs.statcounter.com/screen-resolution-stats

            11) Breakpoints for our project : 
                                                1) PHONE ONLY: 0-600px
                                                2) TABLET PORTRAIT: 600-900px
                                                3) LANDSCAPE TABLETS: 900-1200px
                                                4) DESKTOP: 1200-1800px
                                                5) BIG DESKTOP: 1800px +
        
            12) Responsive Images are not only part of responsive design but even more importantly of 
                web performance. Responsive images are crucial for web performance

            13) The goal of responsive images is to serve the right image to the right screen size and 
                device, in order to avoid downloading unnecessary large images on smaller screens.
                For example a 1 megabyte image is absolutely okay to send it to a desktop computer, but 
                it's not okay to send this one megabyte to a phone, which may have a slow or expensive data plan
                somewhere in the world.As developers we rally have a responsibility here and responsive images 
                help us solve these problems.
                So instead of sending one megabyte to whatever device is consuming the page, it makes way more 
                sense to send the one megabyte image to a device with a large screen that actually needs the image 
                and a much smaller version of the image to a device with a small screen that does not need such a 
                large image anyway. This is really advanced stuff .
            
            14) In which situations we actually use responsive images? 
                    1) RESOLUTION SWITCHING: serve up the same image for a smaller screen
                                             but with a smaller resolution.Same image but a smaller
                                             version for a device that doesn't need such a big image
                    2) DENSITY SWITCHING: Special case of resolution switching, but where the screen size 
                                          does not matter but instead a screen pixel density does instead
                                          * pixel density : is the amount of pixels found in an inch or centimeter
                                          Now what matters to us is that there are low resolution screens, and high 
                                          resolution screens. Low resolution screens are just typical PC screens, 
                                          I would say and they called 1x screen, because they use one pixel to display 
                                          one pixel of our design. High resolution screens are the ones found in all 
                                          modern smart phones and even some computers already have them, like the MacBooks
                                          with retina displays and can be called 2x screens because they actually use 
                                          2 two, physical pixels to display one pixel of our design. So if we say that we want 
                                          an image to be 100 pixels high, it will actually be 200 pixels in a physical screen.
                                          And this all happens automatically.
                    3) ART DIRECTION: For example, you may want to keep the important details in an image but remove parts of an 
                                      image around these details or you could also want to load a completely different 
                                      image altogether and responsive images actually allow you to do that.

                There are 3 steps for this to work ,
                1) is to first have a checkbox which will be hidden later,
                2) then second have a label connected to that checkbox which is where we click,
                3) reveal the entire navigation in the background as soon as the checkbox becomes checked
                   and we can use the checked pseudo class in CSS to style this

                This will be the first element in the entire web document.
